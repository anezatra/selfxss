## What is a SelfXSS?
**Self-xss (Self Cross-Site Scripting) is a type of social engineering attack and is often used to deceive users. In this attack, the attacker tries to get the user to run malicious code on his or her device. This tool allows you to perform this attack on sites that do not have XSS vulnerabilities. You can retrieve the target's Cookies and messages.**
## How is it working? 👁‍🗨
**First, send the bitly redirect link to the victim,      
then the malicious address below. Then, if the exploit   
is successful, the cookies will come to the log file**       
` http://example.com/javascript:malicious_code `         
**you can log into the victim's account with the help of     
any cookie editor. The url you see above does not work     
as Instagram at the beginning, because sites prevent this  
attacking.**
